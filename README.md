# Concurrent React Demo

This is just a demo to demonstrate Concurrent React, currently experimental.

## Install
```
npm install
```

```
yarn
```

## Development Mode

To run using `webpack-dev-server` and `express`, use the below command:
```
npm run dev
```

Runs on http://localhost:3000 as default

## Production Build

To run a production build (although it's not recommended to use this in production, as the APIs for Concurrent React can totally change):
```
npm run build
npm start
```

## APIs
This is currently using TVMaze API, and a test users API to test the functionality of Concurrent React
